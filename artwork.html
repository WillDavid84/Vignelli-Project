    <p><strong> Sansoni
            Book Series, 20×12.5 cm each
            1963</strong>

        One of many book series that Vignelli designed for Sansoni, Florence. “We turned the titles sideways to
        introduce large-sized type and reach greater impact at point of sale.” A simple but incredibly strong and
        elegant solution, that was highly innovative for the publishing industry of that time. Although based on a
        schematic layout, the different lenght of the words generate a different cover each time. Beautiful and
        timeless.</p>

    <p><strong>Pneumatici Pirelli
            Poster, 68×48 cm
            1963</strong>

        One of the greatest masterpieces of the Italian graphic design. A completely pink tyre advertisement featuring a
        young lady that ride a bycicle without hands, communicating a sense of absolute freedom and limitless joy. An
        image of women empowerment to advertise an object which is tipically associated with male world.</p>

    <p><strong>Studio Verde
            Poster, c.70×50 cm
            1963</strong>

        Issued by the City of Milan for a conference about green urban design, held the Museo della Scienza e della
        Tenica (Museum of Science & Technology), Milan.</p>

    <p><strong> International
            Poster, 82×122 cm
            1967</strong>

        One of the strongest and most beautiful posters in the history of graphic design. Influenced from the colorful
        overprints that distinguish the graphics of Max Huber—a former flatmate of Vignelli—it features a simpler and
        more rigorous geometric layout. Wonderful!</p>

    <p><strong> York Subway Map
            Foldable Map, 53×44 cm
            1970</strong>

        The product of logics and geometry to simplify complexity. A project that marked the advent of information
        design with an unprecedent awareness.</p>

    <p><strong> Airlines
            Logotype
            1967</strong>

        Designed with Heinz Waibl at Unimark International. Contrary to what people thought for decades, Vignelli didn’t
        designed the stylized eagle that represented the brand. Indeed, he suggested to use the logotype only, set in
        Helvetica, half red and half blue to symbolize the American flag. I think that the true strenght of this graphic
        identity was precisely the typographic pureness that portrayed the company with absolute simplicity and clarity.
