    <p>Designer and artist Massimo Vignelli (Italian, b.1931) was born in Milan, Italy. He is associated with the
        modernist tradition, as he commonly uses simplistic and geometric forms within his work. Vignelli began his
        professional career in Design when he studied architecture at the Politecnico di Milano and the Universita di
        Architettura in Venice. He decided to pursue his interest in general Design rather than becoming an architect.
        He has worked in many different Design fields, including interior, graphic, environmental, furniture, and
        product Design. He moved to New York in 1966 to lead the New York branch of Unimark International, a large
        Design firm that is responsible for many renowned corporate images, such as American Airlines, New York City
        subway, and the Washington D.C. metro. After leaving Unimark International, the designer founded Vignelli
        Associates, through which he has worked with clients such as IBM, Bloomingdales, and Knoll.</p>
